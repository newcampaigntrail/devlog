        <p>This is a blog/devlog for the game The New Campaign Trail. It includes updates and other important information, given that posting to Reddit doesn't have quite the same permanence as something like this does.</p>
        <p>Play the actual game <a href="https://www.newcampaigntrail.com/" target="_blank">here</a> (though I'm not sure how you would manage to find this without playing the game). Play the original game by Dan Bryan <a href="http://www.americanhistoryusa.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Blog site design inspired by, and CSS for pages from <a href="https://evenbettermotherfucking.website/" target="_blank">Even Better Motherfucking Website</a> by Guilherme Pangnotta.</p>
