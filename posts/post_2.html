<h2>The NCT Modmaker</h2>
<em>2023-05-14</em>
<div id="content">
    <p>As a part of the domain shift, the modmaker has been moved to a new subdomain at <a href="https://modmaker.newcampaigntrail.com/" target="_blank">modmaker.newcampaigntrail.com</a>.</p>
    <p>Since we didn't really announce the redux of the modmaker at any point, here is a quick list of the modmaker capabilities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Preview function built into the NCT engine.</li>
        <li>No requirement of working with PK relations - the maker deals with it all for you.</li>
        <li>Portrait size requirement warnings to ensure mods have appropriately sized images.</li>
        <li>Theme builder with colour pickers.</li>
        <li>Clear no-code interface.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And here is a list of limitations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For now: <b style="color:#ff0000">code 1 only</b>. If you would like a code 2 modmaker, have a look at the fantastic 
            <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/thecampaigntrail/comments/134dpvm/announcing_the_release_of_jets_tct_mod_tool/">Jet's TCT Mod Tool</a> (<em>DISCLAIMER: not affiliated with the NCT team</em>).</li>
        <li>The import function <b style="color:#ff0000">has not yet been added</b>. I cannot stress enough that you <b>should not rely on it</b>. However, you can still, of course, export your code 1 for later use by yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the future, expect more updates for the modmaker.</p>
