    <p>I quickly put together a interpreted "scripting" language for TCT Code 2s. You can try it out <a href="https://script.newcampaigntrail.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p>A heavily-commented example of CampaignScript can be found <a href="https://script.newcampaigntrail.com/tests/demo.txt" target="_blank">here</a>. It should be basically self-explanatory.</p>
    <p>In summary, this should make writing Code 2s significantly easier.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Nina from the Discord for help with testing everything and making it user-friendly, and thanks to Gardfeld for the banner thing at the top of the page.</p>
