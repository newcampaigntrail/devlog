<h2>How to be Added to the Mod Loader 101</h2>
<p><em>2023-05-20</em></p>
<div id="content">
<p>With the creation of such programs like code 1 and code 2 makers, our community has reached/is reaching the industrial revolution of TNCT mods (trademark copyright). Mods are able to be made by those with little coding experience, allowing them to focus on the content of their mods more, without getting gummed up in learning a whole language or coordinating with some person over the internet they never met. With such advancements, however, our longtime-held general policies of "add every mod released to the loader" will have to be re-evaluated. If you want a mod on the loader that is yours, here are a few steps (this is adapted from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thecampaigntrail/comments/12ikwah/the_mod_tutorial_part_8_official_mod_loader/">Reddit</a> post Astronomical and I made a while ago):</p>
<strong> Mod length </strong>
<p>We need you to release entirely complete mods, ideally around 25 questions for each side. If something is unfinished, mark it clearly so everyone knows it is not finished. Example <a href="https://preview.redd.it/u7sidw8879ta1.png?width=779&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=12e29da88ef2b0f9b21497a6e7f9f2353c6daaa5">here</a>.</p>
<strong> Grammar </strong>
<p>The mod must be coherent and easy to understand. The base Dan Bryan mods are good, perhaps above-average examples of this. There are a few mods that haven't been added to the loader for this very reason. We have many nice people in this community who may proofread mods for you if you aren't confident in your ability to write.</p>
<strong> Duplicate mods </strong>
<p>Obviously, we don't want two of the same mod in the loader. Before you make a mod, go and search on Reddit for the year/keywords of the mod you are making to see if it is made (and of course look on the loader), or simply just ask. That being said, some mods are overdue for reduxes, and with proper coordination with the community/old creators, we can replace old mods with new ones.</p>
<strong> Inappropriate content</strong>
<p>Recently we had an issue with a mod called Identity War, in which you could lynch a younger MLK. I don't think I need to explain why including that is a bad idea. That being said, racism, homophobia, sexism, and the like all can be included in a mod, but only in small, historically accurate doses. Generally, things like slurs don't need to be in a mod to emphasize an individual's character. Good writers know how to do that with other words. An exception to this may be direct quotes from real-life people.</p>
<strong> Credits</strong>
<p>All those who contributed to your mod deserved recognition, and make sure to reflect that in your credits. This isn't just writers, coders, and artwork (banner) makers, but things like specific snippets of code that make things like music players, or CYOA, things like that. It's always good to ask these individuals if they want credit.</p>
<strong> Other</strong>
<p>A great way to get added to the mod loader is to make IRL elections that haven't been made yet. A nice list of that is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g5vLCOTJfDbDkiVxrQF9s2zB-4G2DBYqzjaDmv4xJpw/edit#gid=0">here</a>. It is long overdue for us to have every presidential election, and making them can get you on the loader easily. Another way you can get on is by making a series of mods that relate to each other. I assume many of you know the Viva Kennedy series and the Bryanverse. They connect mods together in fantastic ways and have become classics in our community. Obviously, they were written well, but still, we are more inclined to put series in a loader due to their ability to make one larger narrative come together, which is more worth "preserving", in a sense, in the loader.</p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
<p>These are basic guidelines on how to get a mod into the loader. If you need more guidance, examine some of the recently added mods there (or some of the coloured ones, which signify their high quality and high status in the eyes of us developers), ot alternatively just ask. More additional features are nice, but at the end of the day, it's quality over quantity. Some of the best mods out there started as basic TNCT mods, and sure they got cool new features along the way (1972 is a personal favourite of mine and an example), but it started with solid research and good writing. Oh, that reminds me, further reading is always nice. Try and include that. That's all for now.</p>
