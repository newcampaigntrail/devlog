<h2>On The Deleting of Achievement Data</h2>
<em>2023-05-14</em>
<div id="content">
    <p>Recently, thanks to the change from <a href="https://newcampaigntrail.github.io/">newcampaigntrail.github.io</a> to <a href="https://newcampaigntrail.com/">newcampaigntrail.com</a>, the local storage keeping themes and achievements on NCT has been reset.</p>
    <p><em>In general</em>, <b>we cannot help recover this.</b> This was an oversight on my [Decstar's] part, and the other devs shouldn't be blamed for this issue. It didn't even occur to me that this would occur during the domain shift.</p>
    <p>If you desperately need certain achievements back, you can contact a dev, and we can have a look into what we can do (in the case of extremely hard-to-get achievements, such as the JFK or 2016a one).</p>
    <p>I would like to offer my deepest apologies for the inconvenience.</p>
