<h2>How do you Portray a Segregationist?</h2>

    <p>I'm sometimes in disbelief that the great scandal over Identity War was just a week ago, and that's probably because of how tiring it was. It was probably the best response I've seen so far from the developers to such a scandal, and that was probably because the developers of the mod itself freely spoke about their motives the entire time. But their response, and the response of a certain number of people in the community, left a lot to be desired.</p>
    <p>Let me make this clear: Strom Thurmond was a politician, and acted like one, regardless of who his views appealed to (which should be very obvious). He was not some racist grandpa who shouted racial slurs every time a black person walked past his porch or something. Yet that's the portrayal the writers of Identity War picked. The writers would later argue that they pursued this to be “historically accurate” and to convey the horrors of segregation, but I honestly never bought that argument, not even for a second.</p>
    <p>It seemed pretty obvious that they were going for shock value, judging from the soundtrack which included, of all things, the Uncle Ruckus song. Now, the developers of the mod argued that one speech, with one arguable instance of him actually saying the N-word, gave them carte blanche to do all this; first of all I think they're wrong about their example, and second, that's not how any of this works. Of course, there were also people telling you that if he wasn't shouting off the N-word like a projectile, or inciting the lynching of a young MLK, that this was “whitewashing history” and the brutal legacy of lynching and segregationist policy in the South. This isn't a perspective that's borne of right-wing ideology, and you can guess that whoever is making this argument is looking at this from a progressive angle, but really it's just more of the profuse ignorance of the sort you only really get to see in a community like ours.</p>
    <p>1948 was not the era of Ben Tillman; America was changing. The civil rights movement wouldn't have gotten off the ground a few years later if it wasn't; was there really as much a sea change when the Tulsa race riots happened or lynching reached its peaks in the 1890s as opposed to the single lynching of Emmett Till? The fact that there wasn't says enough. To be sure, the Dixiecrat splinter was a blatant reaction, and quite a toxic one at that—but the words flying out the mouths of segregationist politicians weren't the sort of things a caricature of a segregationist would say, they were words segregationists actually said, which are far different, and far more clever in how they twist reality. This applies to even the dumbest ones like Lester Maddox, if you bother to actually listen to what they were arguing.</p>
    <p>For instance, Strom Thurmond's actual argument against anti-lynching legislation in 1948 was that it would create a federal police force that would ravage on the Southern way of life. Of course in Identity War, you can't argue that; instead, you have the option of lynching MLK. In 1948, the real Strom Thurmond tried to link the idea of civil rights in the United States to the values of Stalinism in the Soviet Union, with all the usual rhetorical sleight of hand you could expect as necessary to make that leap. In Identity War, their version of Strom Thurmond throws a chair in his office, or shouts off a cacophony of slurs, depending on the day.</p>
    <p>Thankfully mods before this at least tried to do a faithful portrayal of these sorts of segregationist politicians, particularly if they were to be playable characters; even 1948Red with Richard Russell tried notably harder to do that, and it shows. Unfortunately, some people may get the wrong message, and that could mean we have to relive this nonsense all over again.</p>
    <p>So what's the lesson here? If you're making a mod, how do you portray a segregationist? Simple: portray them like human beings. Their morality may be twisted, you may be disgusted by their platform, but if you don't make an effort to show them as they were to the best of your ability, as opposed to say, asking the Reddit how high you should make their “racism level,” you are betraying the very educational, or at least immersive, spirit on which the entirety of The Campaign Trail as a game is based. I hope I made my message clear, so that I won't ever have to repeat it.</p>
