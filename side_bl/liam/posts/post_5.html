<h2>The Enigma of Issue Scores</h2>
<em>2023-05-15</em>
<div id="content">
    <p>Too many people complain about the issue score system, and not enough have a clue of how it works. Unfortunately, that includes a lot of coders. Why? It's probably the one part of the engine that modmen have to deal with frequently that acts like a total black box. It's crucial to making good gameplay, but it's confusing to a lot of people.</p>
    <p>In fact, the worse a mod is, the higher chance that it doesn't use issue scores at all (with an exception to statewide mods). For instance, take a look at Identity War, a mod so bad you have to play it every once in a while just to remind yourself how bad it is. There's maybe one question or two in the whole mod that uses issue scores, the rest of the effects are just ad-hoc. It does have the issues set up, they're just not used by the questions, which hampers the gameplay significantly. But how could they have used issue scores? How do they work?</p>
    <p>Issue scores lay on a scale from -1 to 1. Most people should know this. Ideally, every state should have about 4 or 5 of them, shown to the end user with labels for rough dividing points along the scale. Each state has their own rating on this scale for each of the issues, determining where they stand. Each candidate also has one, which is mixed with the state multipliers to produce your margins.</p>
    <p>This entire system relies first on distance. Some issues are polarizing, with states on one side, a different side, or in the middle of either side; for a base game example, think most of them. Some are one-sided yet important; think the Cold War in 1960. A candidate's standing on issues can have wholesale effects on their margins in various states, dependent on how distant their score is to the score of a certain state. It also relies on multipliers, which determine how strong the effect is and is about as important to the entire system as distance.</p>
    <p>Issue answer effects transport this to specific answers, taking into account both elements. When you answer in one direction on such an answer, it will boost your numbers in the states closer to that stance, while doing the opposite in those states farthest from it. The multiplier determines how strong this is, and is an equally important part of the equation, crucial to getting this right. 1896, for instance, starts out with importance values of 8 or 12 on questions, slowly settling on 1 or 2 after your key positions are already defined. You don't have to set them as high as 1896 does, but it's good to boost importance when needed.</p>
    <p>These alone don't make for good gameplay effects; it's only when they're properly included with pertinent answers that they improve variability in final results, along with the overall gameplay. Simple issue questions can be make or break in close states, which inherently boosts replay value.</p>
    <p>If you still don't get how this works, you can visualize this beast by thinking of the states' stances as a sort of distribution. When you take a stand on an issue, the states closer to it will be more attracted to your candidate, while the farther ones will be more alienated, to certain extents. When I saw it like this a long while ago, I immediately got it.</p>

    <p>Issue scores are a crucial part of how you can build good gameplay into a TCT scenario. How crucial? There is exactly one base game scenario that uses a proxy on top of, or instead of, issue scores: 2020. And how does 2020 do it? By including its behemoth of minute state effects. That's its proxy for issue scores. If you wish to keep that sort of healthy variance while not losing your mind, use issue scores. It's good for your sanity.</p>
