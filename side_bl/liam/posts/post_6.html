<h2>What Not To Do: A Deeply Informative Analysis of Identity War's Coding</h2>
<em>2023-05-20</em>
<div id="content">
    <p>I only decided to write this after reading <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/thecampaigntrail/comments/13ljkt4/the_worst_mod_ever_made' target="_BLANK">Tom’s good analysis of Identity War</a> from the writing side of things. This is going to look at all things coding related, and it commits so many sins on this front that I’m going to use this as an opportunity to inform people of how coding can be properly done, rather than producing a mangled product beyond any hope.</p>
    <p>Let’s start out with the all-necessary Code 1, starting with the essential components, then towards all the bloat. The most obvious flaw here is the images. Here’s how Robert Taft appears, in three different screens, including in the Code 2:</p>
    <figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pCDCxTk.png" alt="Taft in the intro">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://i.imgur.com/AyKeXRX.png" alt="Taft in Code 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hNsYPkz.png" alt="Taft in Code 2 (now in color)"></figure>
    <p>Unless you have a good reason, don’t constantly swap out images (the 1904 redux, a mod I worked on, is an exception which proves the rule). I assume the IW team didn’t have a good reason (it seems as ad-hoc as most everything else in that mod), and that the 1st and 3rd images of Taft were provided by someone who can actually crop and edit images.<sup><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> How do I know? Here’s the first teaser of the mod, with the original one:</p>
    <figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KInAJvo.png" alt="The original intro screen for Identity War (from Reddit)"></figure>
    <p>Makes a difference, huh? In case you haven’t yet learned how to properly crop images for TCT, here’s some steps you could follow in image editors like GIMP, Paint.net, or theoretically MS Paint (if you’re desperate enough):</p>
    <p><ul><li>Election intro photos should be a multiple of 300x160</li><li>Candidate photos should be a multiple of 210x250</li><li>Advisor photos should be a multiple of 208x128</li></ul></p>
    <p>If they aren’t, they’ll show up distorted, as you can see above. Just note stuff like this is an obvious and visible marker of quality, and if you screw it up your mod will be worse off as a result. The same is true for candidate bios, or really, any section of text in the code 1. I will say, I commend the IW team for at least trying to stick to basic HTML. But they actually failed in a lot of parts. Let’s look at Wallace’s bio for instance:</p>
    <figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/F3J4yCy.png" alt="Google Doc screenshot of Wallace's bio in Identity War"></figure>
    <p>In case you didn’t notice, those ‘p’, or paragraph, tags are not enclosed. They’re supposed to be. This is HTML 101. And this does actually make a difference, as the browser interprets it in the following way:</p>
    <figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yAoWnZv.png" alt="How it shows up in inspect element"></figure>
    <p>Thus you get unevenly spaced text, as the text outside the ‘p’ tags don’t follow the same line spacing styling Dan Bryan originally dictated for candidate bios:</p>
    <figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/a51gZJP.png" alt="The same bio ingame"></figure>
    <p>These aren’t things unique to Identity War; plenty of mods have had coders who don’t know any better making the same mistakes—it’s just natural we see it here.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the bios still manage to overflow considerably. Here’s Wallace again:</p>
    <figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/n0UMzir.png" alt="Same shot, zoomed out to show the overflowing"></figure>
    <p>TCT was never intended to have bios this long; too many modders fall into this trap, and they never take the time to trim down their writing in order to make it fit. Here’s 1864 as a comparison:</p>
    <figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vhl9XKC.png" alt="Andrew Johnson's bio in 1864"></figure>
    <p>Get it down to about 8 or 9 lines, and all will be well. It isn’t that hard. If it’s any longer, it will overflow visibly on the screen and is probably too long anyway. Take note of this for later.</p>
    <p>Now for all the auxiliary stuff. The styling seems pretty tacky, but they managed to change everything at least. The banner switch button also makes an appearance, allowing you to switch between…two banners. In case you couldn’t tell, this mod includes a lot of unnecessary things.</p>
    <p>The soundtrack seems impressive, but it genuinely seems like little effort was put into it. Sure they use Decstar’s ‘digital iPod,’ but it’s not implemented correctly<sup><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> (meaning some people are in the unfortunate situation of having two, or even three, soundtracks playing at once while playing this mod). As far as the songs themselves…all of the 1940s songs can be found on a single playlist on YouTube. And as far as the candidate songs, they seemed to have been pretty cheap additions, basically just searching a related term and picking the first results; this was obvious for Thurmond, but true for the others as well. A lot of the songs have no reason to be there; one was for Huey Long, one was for the wrong Taft, and one song called “Isolationism,” from 2018, has no reason to be included in Taft’s soundtrack except its name. And of course, Thurmond’s side has Uncle Ruckus.</p>
    <p>The worst part maybe isn’t any of this. It’s that all of these songs are actually videos, they literally just used YouTube to MP4, took what it spit out, and jammed it into an HTML audio tag (a couple of these files are literally corrupted). Which means I can easily use Inspect Element to get…</p>
    <figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RGJUrLA.png" alt="Uncle Ruckus music video in the Identity War soundtrack"></figure>
    <p>Yes, this is Uncle Ruckus in full quality, inside of Identity War. The worst part about all this, aside from it being incredibly lazy, is that your internet connection has to download video data for all of these songs that you will never end up seeing, eating up God-knows-how-much bandwidth. It makes me glad actual effort was put into the 1864 soundtrack. Guys, just use YouTube to MP3, not MP4.</p>
    <p>Now let’s take a look at the Code 2. For starters, the margins are badly constructed. Sure, some stuff makes sense, but Thurmond’s margins are ridiculous. They’re ad-hoc, done in bits and in a really lazy way. There are many states where he either gets 0 votes or is mightily competitive. He gets no votes in Washington or Oregon, but starts at 11% in California (!!!!!!!). This makes no sense at all, in any way. George Wallace started his run in maybe 1967 or early 1968, and managed to get on the ballot in all 50 states. There’s no reason Strom Thurmond, with a party that’d have been organized for at least two years with significant amounts of funding for a third party, could possibly fail to qualify on the ballot in all 50 states. The only way it makes sense is that the coder was lazy (which is probably true).</p>
    <p>I decided to look at the issue scores as well. The state issue scores seem to be just from 1948 but re-labeled (not really that strange), but the candidate issue scores are a real head-scratcher:</p>
    <figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PAw9qvA.png" width="1000px" alt="The candidate issue scores code in Identity War"></figure>
    <p>That’s right…you’re not seeing double…there are duplicate issue scores; they were that lazy. The game engine will pick the latter, so it doesn’t cause any errors necessarily. Really, it’s just sloppy. Some of the issue scores are for a candidate not even part of the mod, and some of the values are real head-scratchers. For instance, sure, Thurmond’s stance on the “Negro Rights Act” makes sense, but Taft and Wallace seem really low…until you realize that they made “equalism” one half of the issue scale…still, Wallace’s value of 0.25 on this makes little sense given it’s his legislation. Then again, I don’t think the coder really understands issue scores, if at all.</p>
    <p>Anyway…the answer effects are, as I’ve stated before, ad-hoc. There are only 4 issue effects that apply to any answers (along with about 49 that are left over from the base 1948 code and do not apply to any existing answer)...these are all on Taft’s side. The worst part about the effects is how shoddy they’re done, though. For instance, many of the landmines are ridiculously powerful, like these:</p>
    <figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sjWUskx.png" alt="Self sabotage #1">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://i.imgur.com/W43zxzB.png" alt="Self sabotage #2"></figure>
    <p>One thing to understand about multipliers is that they…multiply, relative to how candidates are doing in each state. Therefore, if you multiply by -4, you can expect…a 200% drop? Of course the engine doesn’t work like this, and it probably just bottoms out Taft’s support so much, but it shows, once again, profound laziness in coding; Dan Bryan’s landmines usually hit you by…7-12%? But there’s another thing that shows it even more, and it’s stuff like this:</p>
    <figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JlqC27A.png" alt="Broken answer effect in Identity War"></figure>
    <p>One half of these effects work, the other doesn’t. Do you want to know why? It’s because they’re assigned to the wrong candidate.</p>
    <figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CPXEPfe.png" alt="Candidate, then affecting candidate code for answer effects"></figure>
    <p>When Dan Bryan came up with this system, he wrote scenarios that had questions for both or all candidates; adding effects all together and only having certain ones active at a time made implementing these faster. Of course, mods don’t work by the same rules that Dan Bryan scenarios do, given how Dan Bryan’s serverside shenanigans can’t be replicated through modding, so <u>the “candidate” is supposed to be the active candidate 100% of the time</u>, regardless of who the “affected candidate” is, without exceptions. I did some analysis on how often Identity War breaks this rule.</p>
    <p>Here’s the breakdown by active candidate of how many effects are wrongly applied and thus do not work as intended (on global and state effects only, as issue effects don’t depend on candidates):</p>
    <p>Taft: 7 global, 1 state<br>Wallace: 14 global, 1 state<br>Thurmond: 14 global, 3 state</p>
    <p>Let me restate this: <u>these numbers should be zero!</u> The fact that it’s not, across the board, is a good sign that the modmen aren’t taking their creation too seriously. After at least four months of development, you would expect effort in understanding the game mechanics and producing something to produce the best experience according to those mechanics. Instead, you get answer effects that don’t work.</p>
    <p>I’ll also again speak on trimming. One of the links between writing and coding is getting the writing to show up as it should. Hence why when you write too much, you get stuff like this:</p>
    <figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/R5QCDFl.png" alt="A question in Identity War with text almost flowing off the page"></figure>
    <p>See that word there? Squabble…something. This mod has no business having writing this long, but it does, and it leads to a lot of text overflowing, which hinders gameplay, either because the inherent length of text needed is less optimal for the player, or like seen here it gets hidden by parts of the interface, which is bad for obvious reasons. It disrespects the very medium you’re making this on. Try whatever you can to avoid it. Especially in advisor feedback:</p>
    <figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fSmcPjy.png" alt="Text overflowing in answer feedback so badly that it's partially obscured"></figure>
    <p>Ever play 1864? Ever notice the advisor feedback will always fit within four lines of text, because that’s what’s supposed to fit inside the feedback dialog, and any more will start cutting off text? That’s intentional. Like I’ve pointed out many times before, text overflowing like this actively harms the gameplay experience. In fact, it’s in the feedback dialog where I see it the most, across all mods. This is a lesson that should be learned by all modmen; if you’re not trimming your text to be concise and readable in-game, you’re doing something wrong.<br><br><br></p>
    <p>The recent revolution of storytelling mods has been in some ways incredible to watch, and I should know given I’ve played my part in it happening. I do have some qualms about it, which I will elaborate on at a later date. But while it’s led to a lot of mods with rich content coming out, it’s also encouraged aspiring modmen to try everything at once—throw shit at the wall and see if it sticks—and Identity War is the ultimate example of how bad this could get.</p>
    <p>It should serve as a warning to the aspiring modmen out there. It should be easy to understand how bad its scattershot lore, that flanderizes its characters and produces the most insane circumstances for the sake of producing insanity, including its portrayal of Strom Thurmond as the 1940’s Uncle Ruckus, is.</p>
    <p>But people looking to work in this medium should also understand the flaws in its code, and how it’s consistently unserious. I didn’t even mention how poorly it jams in Decstarware in its Code 2! Seriously, it took stuff right out of 2000N and used it for maybe…one or two things? At most? Like I said…deeply unserious. Unserious use of answer effects, unserious margins…and probably in most if not all other regards.<br><br><br></p>
    <p>When you produce a mod, and most definitely when you code it, try to take it seriously if that’s the aim. Try to best emulate the dynamics of a real election campaign. Have things follow a logical—if fever-dreamish—chain of events (working in conjunction with writers, or being the writer, helps a lot here). <u>Don’t overlook basic things.</u><sup><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> Ensure everything fits within the game’s interface. Don’t put unnecessary stuff in your mod because it’s cool, and then proceed to mess it up…like the half-broken soundtrack with songs barely related to anything else you’re including. Learn a couple of things about coding at least so you’re not a total fool when adjusting the parameters in TCT code. And finally, <u>listen to your fucking playtesters!</u> The worst of mods come about when modmen don’t, and just put out garbage despite having plenty of feedback they could’ve used from their playtesters to improve their creation.</p>
    <p>A lot of the good coders have these things down, and if you’re looking to make a mod and you have these things down as well, you’re most certainly on the right track…but I couldn’t say any of this about Identity War. In case you don’t get it by now, that mod deserves its reputation from top to bottom. I hope I made it clear as to why.</p>
    <p>And by the way…because this particularly pisses me off and I have the opportunity to talk about it…if you have someone screaming, do not use caps in your mod. Just don’t use them. It doesn’t look good, the drama it adds feels more childish than captivating. Dan Bryan never did it, and you shouldn’t either. But Identity War does it on every other question. So I just had to say it.</p>

    <p id="fn-1"><small><sup>1</sup> My personal theory is that Jake Dionysos gave them the images, and this was the extent of his participation aside from *maybe* some ending work (I haven’t spoken to him about this). It’s a shame people like him, Garfield, and Dill Wesmond received heat despite playing no part in monstrosities like the Thurmond side, and were either minor early contributors or mainly added for clout (at least, that’s what I’ve thought this whole time).</small></p>
    <p id="fn-2"><small><sup>2</sup> Though I can’t personally give you any detail as to why, because I’ll never add it to any of my own mods.</small></p>
    <p id="fn-3"><small><sup>3</sup> On that note…Tom told me just now of a theory of his that they put the whole Martha Taft arc in the mod because they probably thought she died in 1948 instead of 1958 (off by ten years). Like I said…don’t overlook basic things. Hell, this mod has quite the number of typos, but stuff like this is way worse than a typo.</small></p>
