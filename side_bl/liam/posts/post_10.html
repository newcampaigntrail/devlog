<h2>Wake up, Mr. Garfield, Mr. Garfield‚Ä¶</h2>

<div id="content">
    <p>Midnight ‚Äò64 was itself quite interesting. I‚Äôve complained before about the extent of this whole narrative thing, but really it set a standard (and I think an erroneous one) that alternate history mods have to have this sort of boxed-in, dark aesthetic to them. The Midnight approach doesn‚Äôt work for everything (in fact, I‚Äôd say it wouldn‚Äôt work for the majority of mods). But it made a big splash when it was released, so aspiring modmen started to use it as a blueprint for their own creations.</p>
    <p>Of course, this is misguided for multiple reasons. Yes, it‚Äôs good quality, but it‚Äôs harder to achieve that quality. The mod has unbelievably dense writing (in fact, I was contacted to help with trimming it down -- yes, it was even longer than it is before I was asked to cut down some of the fat). It has unique narrative takes on gameplay mechanics that require serious skill to pull off (i.e. the other side of Romney/Brooke, made by obummer, one of the best new modders this year).</p>
    <p>I stated previously this was going to be a bad trend. And I was right. We can see the evidence in the new 1884 mod; its premise is that Garfield lives‚Ä¶kind of. I‚Äôll get to that. But first, for the record: I playtested this mod. It is as bad as I remember. None of my feedback, it seems, was taken seriously. And I coded 1864! I know a thing or two about this whole modding business. And still, after three weeks, all the mistakes I remember are there unperturbed.</p>
    <p>The modman behind it is probably some kid; I‚Äôd be shocked if he was past the 9th grade. The name of it (‚ÄúDestiny of the Republic‚Äù) is the same as a book about James Garfield by Candice Millard, which he probably didn‚Äôt read. I can tell because the actual research involved seems incredibly minimal, not just at first glance but throughout the mod. For whatever reason, Conkling is still politically relevant despite still suffering his downfall. Somehow he manages to regain his political capital and challenge Garfield by himself on multiple ballots. Which makes less sense the more context you add‚Ä¶ Conkling, being the Chief Stalwart he was, would have been pleased to take on the opportunity of a second Reconstruction, especially in the context of a Republican supermajority. Does Conkling position himself as the moderate alternative to this Garfield that seems to have been mentally handicapped, perhaps by lead poisoning? We don‚Äôt know because it‚Äôs never explained.</p>
    <p>Very few things are explained, in fact. The running mate selection is atrocious. The description of Robert Todd Lincoln shows an immediate lack of research into his actual character; he seems like a potential ace in electoral politics until you actually look into him, and it was the same story with many of the contemporaries that wished to see him nominated on a Republican ticket. And he knew better than to accept their offer, thankfully. No, he is not wholesome 100. Sorry. An ill Chester Arthur would be useless on the stump, as he likely did not have the energy to do any kind of campaign tour, so in the context of that era his choice makes little sense, or even now. And John St. John even less so‚Ä¶ he was a random pro-temperance governor who took the Prohibition Party nomination because those kinds of men would take on those kinds of nominations. I myself offered a better list of running mates. I heard nothing back on the matter.</p>
    <p>Yes, you heard me right by the way. Republican supermajority, in this era of politics, so well defined by political machines equally-matched. Well, why does that happen? And why does Cleveland still get nominated despite potentially not even winning his governor race (I doubt he would in this environment)? Well, thank Reddit. Yes, Reddit polls. Remember Identity War and the N-word fiasco? Yes, that was also ‚Äúsanctioned‚Äù by a Reddit poll. It‚Äôs the same banal excuse, the modman told me that in private and he will probably say it again and again in public. Did Reddit vote for a washed-up John C. Fr√©mont to be U.S. Senator and a key Radical in Congress? No, they didn‚Äôt. Delegating loremaking to a bunch of random people is not an excuse for bad lore. We‚Äôve already learned this, but I guess people forgot.</p>
    <p>There‚Äôs way more in the lore that doesn‚Äôt make sense. Genuinely, way more. The main takeaway that you should get, though, is that the historical faces with names you read about on Wikipedia were at one point real people. If you want to portray them in alternate situations with any semblance of depth you have to take that into account. In fact, it gets worse in the actual mod.</p>
    <p>Oh yeah‚Ä¶ 25 questions. It feels like way more than that because it‚Äôs such a drag. Now, I just want to address the coding for a second. Functionally, it is okay. In the context of the insanity of the writing, it‚Äôs quite discordant. Various elements aren‚Äôt handled properly. South Carolina just doesn‚Äôt exist. The mod talks about how Garfield stopped Jim Crow, but the South still votes like a collection of rotten boroughs. <i>None</i> of the writing is trimmed. None at all. Instead, scrollbars are placed on <i>every</i> question and <i>every</i> feedback. It actually breaks for some mobile users because of this (‚Äòliterally unplayable‚Äô becomes true, folks!).</p>
    <p>Now why would this be in this mod? Well, not even the writer knows. That‚Äôs right, when he was asked about it while announcing the mod he was genuinely clueless. Which is a huge red flag. There was no writer-coder relationship there, and I place no blame for this on the coder; this mod was doomed from the start. Let me tell you my guess of what happened. The modman wrote up the mod. He sent it to a coder willing to take on the project (TomBox). He should‚Äôve turned it down, but he‚Äôs too nice of a guy to do that. So he just worked with the nonsensical writing he had to deal with, and produced this mod, with only so much playtesting, either that or the modman was unresponsive to feedback. It‚Äôs really incredible, and no good mod will ever be made in this fashion.</p>
    <p>Worst of all, there is no CYOA at all. I don‚Äôt know why. Did the modman even write alternate paths? I wouldn‚Äôt think so. Because no matter what you do, everything follows a specified pattern. The thing about mods written in this sort of way is that they have to offer you genuine paths you can take. Midnight ‚Äò64 pulls this off because it has CYOA. This mod does not. Instead, it is the most railroaded mod ever created.</p>
    <p>It feels awful. Everyone around you has contracted chronic neurosis, and wants to restart Reconstruction with military occupation of Southern states, but if you decide to oppose this, or the following Sherman (yes‚Ä¶General Sherman‚Ä¶üôÑ) occupation of South Carolina, the mod overrides your decision anyway, and punishes you.</p>
    <figure style="overflow-x:scroll;"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thecampaigntrail/comments/14xwfex/coming_soon_1884_destiny_of_the_republic_viva/jrppj0y/" target="_BLANK"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/818130397706846242/1137986035742167133/image.png" alt="What well-thought out lore, I see!"></a></figure>
    <p>The writing frequently goes on for way too long without saying much at all. Answers are either too short or are as long as a novella. A lot of it feels inflated too, just made longer for the sake of it. You‚Äôll have stuff going on and it‚Äôll tell you about how a laundry list of people reacted, it‚Äôll have ten sentences of content that could easily be one sentence without losing any information. You know writing is meant to be read, not for people to just gawk at its length. Trying to actually read everything before you with this mod is just a one-way ticket to quitting it because walls of text every question become incredibly tiring, which for some may seem surprising, I know.</p>
    <p>And often the content tries way too hard. William McKinley runs a marathon every other day to gather dirt for your candidacy. In questions he is seen panting, out of breath, and this is told to you to‚Ä¶I guess‚Ä¶add in the immersion? But there is no immersion. It‚Äôs just hard to play. The scandals are too extra. The Democrats nominate a literal redeemer for Vice President. You get blackmailed by McKinley, knowing you cheated on your own wife but if you give him a cabinet spot he won‚Äôt tell (?). McKinley brings you 50 million pieces of dirt on your opponent. Still, no one sounds like their actual self, which is a detail I don‚Äôt like at all. Garfield even speaks Chinese! Every bit of feedback says ‚ÄúMr. Garfield‚Äù...some even multiple times. Your wife becomes ill. You get shot‚Ä¶again‚Ä¶ and you die in the ending. Literally every single ending in this mod leads to your death. And they are 95% the exact same.</p>
    <p>Now in the context of 1864, this dynamic makes sense because Abe‚Äôs assassination was a real historical event, and your actions still affect the outcome of America‚Äôs future. Instead, in this mod, you get wish fulfillment. Just pure wish fulfillment. Robert Todd Lincoln becomes president, because you still take the oath of office from the hospital bed. And he continues Reconstruction II. It is like ShermanPosting in mod form. It is like if you got Midnight ‚Äò64 from Wish.com or Aliexpress. It is the closest thing we have gotten to Identity War since Identity War. It even has a lynching happen, but far from the White House and in a time where that sort of thing was much more common in the South (one of the few things in the mod which makes any semblance of sense). And a lot of the excuses people are making for it also happen to apply to Identity War. It even has grammar mistakes peppered in every corner like Identity War.</p>
    <p>A lot of these complaints that I‚Äôve made I directed to the modman, being a playtester. I told him to go back to the drawing board on this. He did not listen. Three weeks later, nothing changed. Even the same grammar mistakes I noticed then appear now (i.e. ‚ÄúMe and [...] have saw‚Äù). I‚Äôve spoken about this attitude before, and how it doesn‚Äôt help. He told me he was busy around the time this mod was finished, but apparently he could still write this all down within, say, a couple months. Couldn‚Äôt he at least run everything through Grammarly?</p>
    <p>I told him not to release this mod. I told him to do something on a smaller scale to learn the chops, and then work on this having known the ins and outs more, and maybe taking some time to understand basic aspects of coding. Then he could flesh out the timeline, or work on alternate paths instead of this railroaded mess. I even told him people to talk to for help! He didn‚Äôt listen. It sucks, and he doesn‚Äôt care. The worst part isn‚Äôt the former, it‚Äôs the latter. And he shouldn‚Äôt feel stuck with this release version of the mod. No one should with their stuff, really; things can always be changed and improved. But I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever see that with this.</p>
    <p>Really, what it should be is a cautionary tale that reflects what I have constantly warned against through my column‚Ä¶literally everything‚Ä¶if you want to understand then read everything else I have published through this column. The meta right now has taken the idea of ‚Äúquality‚Äù in the wrong direction, and that meta brought us this poorly-inspired mess. Be glad it won‚Äôt be like this forever. Things got worse, but they will get better very soon. But it absolutely will not be because of this mod.</p>
