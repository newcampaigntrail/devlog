<h2>In Defense of Gameplay</h2>
<em>2023-06-15</em>
<div id="content">
    <p>As I played the new Lodge mod this week, I thought about something—sure, this is well made, the writing is quite good and it’s well put together. But there’s one thing I couldn’t fail to notice about it, and it’s how much it tries to be a narrative mod. It isn’t unique in this at all. In fact, have you noticed how many major releases these past few months have put narrative aspects before gameplay, or otherwise treated it as secondary?</p>
    <p>I for one believe the modding meta is worse if it influences modmen to turn their creation into a glorified visual novel for it to be considered “good.” This is something that’s been on my mind for weeks. But how did we get here? I think it’s important to understand this to resolve it, even if some of us contributed to it.</p>
    <p>Part of it relies on how New Campaign Trail inherently works. Instead of asking a server to spit out a dynamic set of questions and answers, the codes are loaded client side, static and unchanging; and one of the main advantages of the original site is that the questions come in a shuffled, semi-randomized order, increasing gameplay potential. This is inherently gone on New Campaign Trail by the very way it works, and it’s left its mark on how people construct their mods.</p>
    <p>When modding was in its early phases, the great mods of the time—such as 1972 or 2008, which remain the gold standard, or Viva Kennedy which is probably still the most popular mod this community has ever seen—followed the Bryan formula very well. The worse mods did so as well, but not with any authenticity or flavor, which ultimately doomed them. Modders still approached things differently (this is why much of the feedback meta is absolutely rancid), but what they knew was Dan Bryan, and what they made reflected that.</p>
    <p>What changed? With the dimension of randomization neutered, modmen began to flesh out more narrative aspects. The first example that stuck with people was 1864, a mod which was fully justified in taking the direction it did, given the circumstances of that year, and the tiring effect the war had on many men, including Lincoln. But it did not change the meta overnight; it’s a 50 question behemoth that stands on its own, and released around the same time as other great mods like 1920b, which is of a scale more befitting most mods while still being excellent, especially with gameplay.</p>
    <p>Of course, 1972d was really the mod to shift the meta in this direction. It releasing was like Pandora’s Box in ways I’ve detailed on many previous occasions, because of course a mod where you play as a communist would be the one to, in some drastic ways, poison the modding meta. Its influence has dictated over time to the new generation of modmen that if you wish to make a good mod, it must be a tiring exercise of narrative.</p>
    <p>This is not good. Thankfully there are a number of modmen who don’t listen, either for good or bad reasons, but it’s been a defining characteristic of the recent meta which has drastically overextended itself. Modmen already wrote long enough before—I can think of, say, Wallace 1972 as an early example—but now it’s just ridiculous. I found 1793 to have appropriately fragile gameplay, but every victory gives you a novella for an ending. It’s done well and is excellent in a vacuum, but how will it influence aspiring modmen?</p>
    <p>1964 Midnight is so heavy on lore that it almost bursts at the seams, and believe me, it’d be worse if I wasn’t recruited to trim it down. It’s pretty tiring, but that’s the point. The whole timeline is like dropping a screw into a turbine engine; it makes sense. A majority of the mod ideas out there aren’t meant for this treatment, but now they’ll get it by default. 1968 Romney is (unfortunately) guilty of this in different places. And the Lodge mod has this attitude throughout, and it shows in how lengthy and overbearing some sequences are. These are not “pretender mods” by any means; they’re just forced by “what’s cool” right now into engaging the player by taxing them rather than thrilling them. In fact, the easiest manifestation of this effect you can pick up on is how lengthy modmen make their writing.</p>
    <p>Somewhere in the meta for good mod writing, conciseness got lost in translation and the most common standard became to fill your mod with as much writing as possible, no matter if it contained relevant information. There was a 2012 redux announced around the same time as 1972d that did exactly this; the writing shown was generally good, but it meandered all over the place and was way too long in most circumstances. When I acknowledged this truth in the announcement post’s comments and gave the modman some advice, here was the response:</p>
    <figure style="overflow-x:scroll;"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thecampaigntrail/comments/11bwwbz/2012redux_mod_announcement_code_one/ja0db9h/" target="_BLANK"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rKx1jO4.png" alt="The comment in question"></a></figure>
    <p>At least the modman is open to advice, which I was relieved about, but you can see the other user expressing what many genuinely believe—that quantity means quality. In reality, the more you make your writing concise, the better. Spongebob 2008 is probably an example of what happens when you ignore the virtue of writing concisely. Considering what it’s supposed to be, its writing has genuinely no business being as long as it is. Here it is compared to the original 2008:</p>

    <p>I mean… yeah, Patrick’s trying to go in on the brainiac bit… but it’s so overdone that the text had to be enclosed with a ‘small’ tag… It’s a shame because this mod sticks to not taking things too seriously, and does it in an appropriate manner, but the writing is so long at times that if it was in normal size it would literally flow off the page. Wouldn’t it be great if Patrick’s dialogue was much shorter, allowing the humor to punch through more to the player? But instead, because of how absurdly long it is, the content ends up heavily diluted; much of what’s on the screen is not needed. It does not make your writing “better.”</p>
    <p>There’s a reason why I’m possibly the most stringent modman in the community when it comes to fitting text into the game interface; if it’s concise enough, that means the information you’re trying to convey is compact enough, which means it’s most efficient in carrying it to the player, which inherently makes gameplay better. It’s the first step to making good gameplay, before even coding the mod. And yet <u>conciseness has never been as ignored in the modding meta as it is right now</u>. Let that sink in. The problem is much bigger than just this one thing, but it’s the easiest part of it for a layman to spot.</p>
    <p>I think that mods can be great in the narrative style or a traditional gameplay-oriented style. But the former has made itself the norm at the expense of the latter. This is bad. If no one tries to correct this course, plenty of good mod ideas will get turned into exhausting mush for no reason. Add dynamism, look to where it’s been done the best. Make judicious use of RNG (a tool which has been slandered far too much over time).</p>
    <p>The meta needs balance; it is not balanced; bring that balance into being. I’m glad that I was able to produce one of the biggest major releases to buck this recent trend (Powell ‘96; and 1924b, which I did not work on, is as golden like its predecessors, and does not fall into the narrative trap). I’m putting this piece out there because I know there are seasoned modmen out there that will agree with me, and also because this is something aspiring modmen should understand.</p>
    <p>Some may ask what I myself will try to do about this, if I’ve already written enough about it here. “Be the change you wish to see in the world,” as some might say. I’m just going to sign off by confirming balancing this modding meta, and bringing great gameplay back into the fold, will be the exact overarching focus of my upcoming modding endeavors. Stay tuned.</p>
