    <p>Friends,</p>
    <p>I do not have the time to publish a column this week. Instead, I will publish a simple and solemn piece of advice that any aspiring modman should understand, and that while I have voiced before I feel I should emphasize more clearly.</p>
    <p><u>Listen to your playtesters.</u> <u>Solicit feedback throughout the process, and listen to it sincerely.</u> A lot of the mods which have at least underdelivered (1984b, 1988IC's first iterations, the original 1904, and a few others), and at worst incited controversy due to their atrocious quality (IW: <a href="#1" target="_BLANK">1</a>, <a href="#2" target="_BLANK">2</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thecampaigntrail/comments/13ljkt4/the_worst_mod_ever_made/" target="_BLANK">3</a>, <a href="#6" target="_BLANK">4</a>), have this one factor in common. If you've messed something up, or worse, if you have no idea what you're doing, it's a good thing to have someone else catch it, and I shouldn't need to say this, but there are a lot of people out there that have received advice that could help drastically improve the quality of their mod, and simply refused to consider it for a multitude of foolish reasons.</p>
    <p><u>Time is not an excuse</u>; a rushjob is a rushjob, but you should never feel a rush to simply put a mod out, especially if you neglect the playtesting process. In fact, it's worse the more time you spend on a mod, because it means you've missed more opportunities to have someone with fresh eyes look at your creation. I've heard stories of some of the worst cases of this, and they're genuinely illuminating. Imagine a modman making awful grammar mistakes left and right, then having someone propose fixing them only for the modman to just revert it back. This is exactly the sort of thing you should avoid at absolutely every turn.</p>
    <p>I wouldn't be speaking the virtues of listening to feedback (which, in a just world, we would all acknowledge by this point) if it hadn't helped me before. After we at the National Union Gang put out the first running mates for 1864, /u/OneLurkerOnReddit put out a good post critiquing the "coda" sections, and different issues with them generally. This had actually slipped past our playtesting process, so the issues (some of them dumb mistakes, to be frank) hadn't been caught before released. They ended up being fixed within days because we listened to feedback.</p>
    <p>I hope I don't have to say this again: playtesters aren't meant to be your yesmen. You're not a dictator, you're a modman. If they spot a mistake, fix it. If they give you a piece of advice, or a truckload of it, seriously consider it. If you just ignore it because you think you're better than your playtester, you're not and you should grow up.</p>
