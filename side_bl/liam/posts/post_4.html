    <p>Friends,</p>
    <p>I did not have the time set out to write a column for this week. Instead, I'd just like to make an addendum on adequate research sources. Why use Wikipedia? Seriously? When the Library of Congress is simply a better "jumping point" on various occasions. This is useful for older presidential elections, many of which have yet to be done. <a href="https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/elections/index.html" target="_blank">Check it out</a> (1789-1920).</p>
    <p>There are also plenty of older websites (some which are only accessible with archives, I'm afraid) that provide information. I've found this particularly useful as I research for my next endeavor (which you will be hearing about relatively soon). I should also redouble my point last week about newspaper archives; yes, if you know where to look and what to look for, they provide rich detail, the sort of detail people who write books look for. Especially for older elections; much of 1904 was written using newspaper accounts for instance.</p>
