<h2>A Retraction (and some updated thoughts on this whole PwH mod thing)</h2>

    <p>Over my life I’ve done/created a lot of things which I’m proud of. My last column, much less so. Sometimes I just become too brash and overly confident for my own good, and every time I inevitably screw up and face the consequences (which I should even if they suck). Multiple modders with which I have mutual trust asked me to write about the emerging fad of the so-called “Peace with Honor” genre of mods, but they are not responsible for the approach I took on this topic. There are parts of that column that I still stand by (mainly my analysis of PwH itself). And then there are others where I went ahead and wrote overly flaming critiques of mods that do not exist (or ones in progress for which I had very little to go off of), with undiplomatic descriptions of people I have never met. The way I went about this was undeserved for the many people in our community, and I will be retracting that column out of my own volition.</p>
    <p>I still believe there are lessons aspiring modmen can learn, so I will try to write something brief on it that speaks on it better and more clearly:</p>
    <hr style="height:auto;">
    <p>“Peace with Honor” is a stellar mod in the way it puts you in the seat of Richard Nixon seeking re-election, and allows you to genuinely shape the legacy he has on America. Part of this is how changing his course of action changes the opponent you face. This gameplay mechanic really caught on with people; so much so that they started sharing their own ideas for what could constitute a “Peace with Honor” mod.</p>
    <p>But I think people were confused about what “Peace with Honor” ultimately was; there was even a post from someone asking whether a ‘normal’ or ‘traditional’ Nixon ‘72 could come out. But the truth is that “Peace with Honor” is just the Nixon side for 1972. It’s not a special new genre of mod.</p>
    <p>There have been plenty of incumbency mods that also go years back into someone’s presidency and change candidates (generally 3rd party ones) based on factors you choose earlier on. It’s just that “Peace with Honor” took that to a further extent simply because it could, and Nixon’s actions made it quite the appropriate gameplay mechanic. It was designed not to fit a specific concept, but a specific candidate.</p>
    <p>There were some people that just felt like suddenly any good election year needed its “Peace with Honor.” Plenty of ideas were shot around on the subreddit, and a lot of these people were probably just kids that didn’t know any better. And it wouldn’t be the first ‘fad’ of its kind if it resulted in mods that just slapped the concept onto any kind of candidate; after all we had the same thing with soundtracks just a few months ago.</p>
    <p>And truthfully if you were to just copypaste PwH’s superficial concepts (not necessarily the idea of molding a president’s legacy, just the changing candidates and cool CYOA) the end product would in all likelihood be bad, faulty, flawed, etc. But if you just want to make a presidential simulator, then that’s where you can develop mods with genuinely fitting concepts behind them that can accomplish their educational goal about as well as “Peace with Honor” itself.</p>
    <p>Hopefully a lot of the people throwing around the term “Peace with Honor” were just thinking about an incumbency mod, or a presidential simulator. Because at that point the concept is not specific to one man, or one year, and it can be fleshed out to really any proper scenario. Someone recently suggested FDR during WWII. Most definitely Washington. Lincoln 1864 already fits this bill. So does like every Bryanverse mod. And Romney 72. All of these have CYOA of some kind somewhere because of their scope (or in the case of 1864, only for Butler lol). But they don’t try to hit some sort of quota of changing candidates, they try to either educate the player about real life or the alternate world it portrays (though good alternate history does both simultaneously). Nor should any similar kind of mod in the future.</p>
    <p>And if what you’re thinking of is a presidential simulator, just call it that. It’s little stuff like that that saves a lot of people a lot of confusion. Our community needs a better naming meta anyways.</p>

    <p>Today I also wrote a reply to the developer of the (expanding) “2020 MAGA” project (which I hope to be in much better hands than I initially expected) which you can read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thecampaigntrail/comments/16bvhs8/did_anyone_read_astrohunchs_last_blog_column/jzh2f00/" target="_BLANK">here</a>, containing my more informed thoughts on said project as well as some advice which should work for most presidential simulator-type mods.</p>
