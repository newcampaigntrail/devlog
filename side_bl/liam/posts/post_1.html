<h2>How "Pretender" Mods are Driving New Levels of Feature Creep</h2>
<em>Archive from 2023-04-09</em>

    <p>The "New" in New Campaign Trail is as large as ever; of course this has let some great mods with vivid ideas burst out of nowhere and produce incredibly immersive experiences. But now a great deal of overambitious modders are trying to catch up, with disjointed results. These days, there seems to be one main way you can tell apart a good mod from a pretender: feature creep.</p>
    <p>It was always kind of there since the theming stuff was added. Now it's worse and I blame exactly one mod for bringing that onto us: 1972d.</p>
    <p>Insane theming. Insane scenario. The first implementation of the "digital iPod" (at least, that's what I call it) that anyone seemed to care about (more on that later). A wide variety of endings. COMMUNISM (and people delude themselves and think it's wholesome). You get the deal. People went nuts for it. They thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread.</p>
    <p>It's very cohesive, but the new toys it included turned to cheap gimmicks the moment they (naturally) ended up in other hands. This is not a trend limited to TCT modding at all, but I've just noticed it get bad now.</p>
    <p>It reached its climax just recently with the simultaneous release of two 1948 mods with an incumbent Henry Wallace, a Republican, and a Southern Democrat. Of course, both had complete themes, one even with a banner switcher (a feature I have never thought useful). There's a plethora of insane endings. And of course, because apparently a mod cannot be pushed out without one, a digital iPod with multiple hastily-curated playlists.</p>
    <p>The writing? It was stilted on both. Both felt like a total drag to play, oftentimes I felt I wasn't controlling a candidate but instead a caricature. Sure, both mods had a lot of flashing lights, but in the departments where it hurts to skimp out, they still did, and it showed. This is avoidable, and I think more up and coming modders should understand this.</p>
    <p>These aren't the only mods that decided, suddenly, to rip out such new features and transplant them into their own creations for little to no reason. It has become a genuine trend. But modders should avoid doing so unless the rest of what they're producing justifies it, else it just pretends to be a good mod instead of actually being one.</p>
    <p>Mods like this are also created on the principle of, above all, producing crazy maps. No, that should not be the main goal of your mod. It never was for the best ones out there, and it never will be. It doesn't reflect seriousness; and as a modder, you should at least be honest about it, because if not, it will hinder the potential of what you could produce in the future.</p>
    <p>1864 has a lot of grandeur to it, but it's totally justified. The story of Lincoln's re-election in the midst of civil war could not be told in 40 questions, so it was told in 50. It didn't need a dozen banners with a changer for them, it has just one. The theming is coherent. It has a multi-track soundtrack, sure, but the motley of tunes produced in the midst of this specific conflict are numerous enough to justify this. People loved Powell 96, and it had no soundtrack at all! What the story it's telling justifies it having, it has, and what it doesn't, it doesn't. This is generally true for genuinely good mods.</p>
    <p>You don't have to Google search for different songs that'd fit your Republican, your Democrat etc., instead try to learn more about the time period you're basing your scenario on. You can read a few books, watch some documentaries and interviews to accomplish. Increase the immersion writing-wise: keep it concise, avoid cheap gimmicks, work in an ordered fashion to ensure cohesiveness. What you produce will be much better.</p>
    <p>One final rule of thumb: immerse yourself before you attempt to immerse the player base; all good mods have been produced from this basis. Because otherwise it's not actually a good mod; it's just a middling one pretending to be a good one. And frankly, we'd be much better off with more of the former than the latter.</p>
