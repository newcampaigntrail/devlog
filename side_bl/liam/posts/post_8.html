<h2>A Third Bonus Post</h2>

    <p>Friends,</p>
    <p>I'm in the same situation as last week, so not much I can write for this column. But I still managed to find something cool enough that I could make the topic of a bonus post.</p>
    <p>There's this obscure Wordpress site with a textual overview of every presidential election in American history; it has about everything you should know about it, as far as overviews go. Linked here:</p>
    <p><a href="https://presidentialcampaignselectionsreference.wordpress.com/overviews/" target="_BLANK">https://presidentialcampaignselectionsreference.wordpress.com/overviews/</a></p>
    <p>It's much more detailed than a Mr. Beat video and much more consistent than Wikipedia. It provides details on the contesting parties, important figures, key events and issues, quotations, as well as a chronology of relevant events and at least one useful source.</p>
    <p>It gives details of what happened in the run-up to the conventions, how the conventions each went about their business, then the issues, the mechanics of the campaign, turning points, slogans, the legacy of the election, among other things. Then finally it gives a long chronology. Here's <a href="https://presidentialcampaignselectionsreference.wordpress.com/overviews/19th-century/1840-overview/" target="_BLANK">the 1840 page</a> as an example. It mentions specifically how the Whigs were practically able to re-invent the presidential campaign around their man “Tippecanoe.” If you're looking to make a mod on a presidential election it's practically perfect as a “starting point.”</p>
    <p>Forget Wikipedia. Just don't use it aside from numbers (most of the time). But keep this bookmarked instead if you intend to hash out a couple presidential election mods and need to do research.</p>
