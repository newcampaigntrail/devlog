<h2>The Wikipedia Mod Strikes Back</h2>
<em>Archive from 2023-04-23</em>
<div id="content">
    <p>This Friday, yupperdoo—of 1936c infamy—released two ‘reduxes’ of old, early-20th century mods to the masses. One involves the election of 1900 and the other 1908. I expected to be disappointed by these two mods, and I indeed was.</p>
    <p>As expected, the writing was dull—in the style of Dan Bryan, except with all of the emotion taken out. The answer effects leave much to be desired, and in some cases don't make sense; also with regards to coding, the number of issue scores is unusually large, with many too irrelevant, both in real life and through the course of the mod to demand their existence (there are around 8 total). Of course, these are far less well researched than anything Dan Bryan ever put out; that might be, in fact, their worst issue overall, and it's something that's plagued a lot of mods over the years.</p>
    <p>1900 and 1908 fall right into the category of the dreaded “Wikipedia mod”: when modders rely on the most overused source on the Internet as opposed to even the sources Wikipedia cites. What this naturally leads to is a whole load of missed opportunities; misperception of key issues, missing key moments of the campaign, falling short on things like running mate selection. The deficiencies of Wikipedia mods are minimal on their own, but add up quickly, leading to a boring experience that hampers the educational aspect of Campaign Trail.</p>
    <p>I'll leave my review of these two mods at the bottom of this; instead the rest of my column will be dedicated on how to research for a mod.</p>
    <p>First, if you wish to read through Wikipedia at all, don't read through the article for your election; instead, look at the bottom of it, and refer to the different books and such in the Further Reading section. When searching for good resources, look for audiovisual sources as well, which are probably the easiest to consume; this only works well for anything from the Great Depression to now, but there are a good number of presidential elections which have good documentaries, for instance; “Making of the President” is not only in book form but has 3 documentaries from 1960 to 1968, and other elections especially in the 80s and 90s also have good documentaries. Alternatively, you could consult C-Span, especially for anything in the past 40 years or so, even if it's just to see how a candidate speaks.</p>
    <p>As far as books go, anything specifically on the election is perfect; otherwise, you can consult detailed biographies on specific candidates, or books with general history of that political era if you wish. These generally give great detail of the issues of the time, and the nature of the candidates, essential information for any mod. To get a copy, if you don't wish to purchase, you can look in a local library (perhaps search their catalog online) or look in archive.org's Open Library, which would at least have copies to borrow if not download. Newspaper archives are also great to consult for finer details of campaigns, or for more obscure elections. You can also consult online news for anything 1996 or above; the Wayback Machine is your friend in this regard, and you can look through sites like CNN, NYT, or WaPo over the years and seek out useful information.</p>
    <p>There are also dedicated online resources to a number of elections; 1896 has the best one for a single election, but HarpWeek (which provides information based on the archive of Harper's Weekly) is absolutely invaluable for anything from the latter half of the 19th century, especially for the period from 1862 to 1886 when Thomas Nast worked for them. <a href="https://www.harpweek.com/" target="_blank">Their website</a> provides plenty of information from 1860 to 1912, including biographies of the candidates, a chronicle of events, and a timeline of what happened during that election, as well as a plethora of political cartoons of the time. It's highly useful to not only create Code 1 biographies of the candidates, but also to get a sense of what happened during these elections which aids further research much better than Wikipedia ever could. Even just scanning it and comparing to the 1900 and 1908 mods, I noticed a plethora of missed opportunities.</p>
    <p>If you are looking for further advice on researching feel free to ask. The rest of this column is my abbreviated reviews of both of these new mods.</p>

    <h2>Reviews</h2>

    <h3>1900 (Yupperdoo redux)</h3>
    <p>This feels like 35 questions of nothing. There's plenty of banal issue questions which are tedious to properly answer (much unlike 1896), and the gameplay aspect is awful, often leaving you right back where you started. It's bloated in places it doesn't need to be, and spreads itself thin in the most essential of parts. 1896 was a far more pivotal election, but even this feels like it doesn't capture why the following election could possibly be interesting; truthfully, it's missing a whole lot, like the previous year's state elections, the genuine folly of free silver, George Dewey's bid crashing and burning, Mark Hanna's pronouncements on the trail... I could seriously go on. For some time this mod glitched to 2000's electoral vote and popular vote counts, but that's not a factor in my opinion of this mod.</p>
    <p><b>SCORE:</b> 2/10</p>
    <p><b>VERDICT:</b> Instant redux</p>

    <h3>1908 (Yupperdoo redux)</h3>
    <p>This ‘redux’ somehow found a way to be worse than the one for 1900. In part because it's often indistinguishable from it; around a third of the questions feature either only the slightest of modifications or none at all, even when this would make no sense to do. Some of the questions are actually directly ripped from Snoo's 1908, even if only the question text remains, and represent a large part of the differences between the 1900 redux and this one, believe it or not. As you can expect, much of what made this election interesting is missing from this mod. The 1900 redux seems to have been made in two weeks; the 1908 one, in an afternoon.</p>
    <p><b>SCORE:</b> 1/10</p>
    <p><b>VERDICT:</b> Instant redux</p>
