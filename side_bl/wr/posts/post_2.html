<h2>The Worst Mod Ever Made?</h2>
<em>Archive from 2023-05-19</em>
<div id="content">
    <p>Is probably 1988IC. Or maybe 1868Sumner. Or 2012ChrisChan? But, I mean, all three of those mods are still fun. For the first game at least. And then the absurdity of the scenario or the execution starts to ware and they grow gradually more exhausting. But they were still fun at some point. Some person played them and enjoyed them, which makes them valuable in their own right regardless of whatever problems they had. There couldn't possibly be a mod so underdeveloped and poorly written that it lacks any fun, right?</p>
    <p>Oh. We're talking about <em>that</em> mod. 1948 Identity War. Well, strap in. And if you ain't reading allat or "common Tom1923," I don't blame ya. This is principally a post for aspiring modders.</p>
    <p>I always found it a little strange how a culture of scrutiny had developed in this community. After all, this is an election web game. There are plenty of imperfect scenarios—in fact, one could say every scenario is to a degree imperfect. Whether bias, poor implementation of answer effects, poor research, or any other sort of issue, something usually goes wrong. But the fact fun can be had, in my opinion negates this issue. I disagree with the opinions of a lot of so-called elitists in this community.I've said it before, and I stand by this, the criteria for a good mod are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The writing should be legible.</li>
        <li>The coding should be functional.</li>
        <li>The material should not be offensive or insulting.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>That's incredibly lenient. And rightly so. We shouldn't be setting our bars so high that it makes aspiring modmakers afraid to dip their toes in the water. Many of us now in what is indisputably the TCT Golden Age forget that we at one point went weeks without new mods. And in today's era we get new mods every few days.</p>
    <p>But with this golden age has come with downsides, certainly. My friend Calgar77, who made the fantastic 1936L warned of a deluge of poorly-produced mods after the release of Jet's Modding Tool. But I don't think that's a bad thing. Failing on executing a mod idea is better than not making anything at all. Jet's Modding Tool seems like a great training wheel for aspiring modmakers. We shouldn't be so quick to cast aside peoples' creations. The fact there are so many new modmakers is exactly why constructive criticism of the kind I hope to make in this post is so important.</p>
    <h3>The Coding</h3>
    <p>Now, this is not a point that I will lag on because truthfully I am not a coder and there's not much real insight I can give. What I can do is point to what who I believe is our community's best non-dev coder has said about the mod. He has pointed out how almost none of the questions even use issue scores, which is nuts.</p>
    <blockquote>"<em>For instance, take a look at Identity War, a mod so bad you have to play it every once in a while just to remind yourself how bad it is. There's maybe one question or two in the whole mod that uses issue scores, the rest of the effects are just ad-hoc. It does have the issues set up, they're just not used by the questions.</em>" — <a href="/side_bl/liam/reader/#5" target="_blank">Liquid Astro on Modding, Issue Score Edition</a></blockquote>
    <p>Astrohunch has also pointed out how the music the mod uses is in video form, which probably increases lag on the site or something. Idk.</p>
    <p>What I'm good at is writing, and that's exactly why I'm here.</p>
    <h3>The Writing</h3>
    <p>Your first question is your most important as a writer. It sets the tone for the campaign to come and helps define both your candidate and the general vibes of the time. There are several ways a mod can start out. Traditionally, a mod starts with your acceptance speech, which would set the tone early that a mod will be a more traditional scenario focused on the issues. Or a mod can start with a candidate's reaction to or action on an important political event of the time period in the prelude to the election. This sort of start helps establish that player choice and/or immersion will be your mod's vibe. A Taft playthrough begins like this:</p>
    <figure style="overflow-x:scroll;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jreS9XM.png" alt="Opening question as Taft in 1948IW. Taft is sobbing about the death of his wife."></figure>
    <p>Now, it's not necessarily a <em>bad</em> idea to start your mod with a question divorced from politics and instead focus on some sort of emotional appeal. You just have to have the writing chops not to make it read as stilted or unserious. 1948IW doesn't have those writing chops so the execution reads as stilted and unserious. Part of a question is fundamentally to provide with numerous answers. The creators of IW have essentially framed this choice as "save your wife or get a small polling boost." If you don't save Martha and lose the election there's an ending where Taft crumbles at her grave and dies. The 'moral' Taft option has him written like a soap opera widow whose lost her husband in a car crash and spends the rest of the series crying helplessly about it. In actual real life, Taft was stern and pedantic. The concept of him weeping publicly like this, shouting at his friends in teenager-like outbursts or dying of emotional damage(!) is ludicrous. Just because something sounds cool doesn't mean it will make sense.</p>
    <p>Question 1 is the beginning of the problems in the mod, even on the Taft side, which is by far the most forgivable. In Question 2, sending your running mate to be with Tom Dewey has Dewey arresting him, for... some reason?</p>
    <p>Furthermore, Question 5 for Taft is simply nuts. For Dirksen, having speak prompts liberals walking out and Harold Stassen "flipping off" Robert Taft. For Saltonstall, who I would remind you, dear reader was a fiscal conservative letting him speak prompts a conservative walkout... against Taft. This makes just about as much sense as you would think.</p>
    <p>And the beginning for Wallace isn't much better. It introduces a faux attempt at alt-history, because you can choose something that truly would make a major change to history by not dropping the bombs. The mod claims Operation Downfall is a massive failure, but it has no effect on the rest of the election besides margins. In 1948Red, which has a similar concept, the downfall of Downfall has a major effect on the mod and mod lore. Now, I won't be comparing and contrasting IW with Red for the remainder of the post because that's a very unfair comparison considering they're two different mods—as well as my own bias.</p>
    <p>If Taft is characterized as an overemotional teenager in 1948IW, Wallace is portrayed as an extreme progressive, and that may seem reasonable. After all, Wallace in 1948 ran under the Progressive Party as one of the most progressive major third party candidates in the nation's history. And in IW he's essentially the same. The massive problem with this is that Wallace in our OTL in 1948 was on the outside. In this timeline, he's the incumbent fucking president. There's no logical reason Wallace wouldn't be the slightly more progressive New Deal Democrat he actually was as Vice President and during the vast majority of his tenure in the Truman Administration.</p>
    <p>By this point, you've probably noticed a common theme. And that's that the characters presented in IW are little more than caricatures of who they actually were. I can only imagine this is because the writers of IW did little-to-no research about the actual figures they were covering, or the actual issues of 1948. Conversation about school prayer being taken out by the Supreme Court and a Civil Rights Act, and the widescale third party candidacy of a Southern Democrat makes me imagine the writers essentially just threw the 1960s at the 1940s and imagined it would somehow come together to make sense. It doesn't. And the mod makes no effort to understand the actual issues of the 1948 Election, and it is infuriating to anyone who understands how interesting that election, and the characters of that election truly are.</p>
    <p>The endings only make things worse. See, friends, the point of an ending is to culminate the work of a player's campaign. A greater margin or a specific set of choices on the Trail should give you a unique ending in a good mod that pushes history in a potentially new direction. 1948IW understands this, but throws the concept to its most extreme and dysfunctional. There must be about a dozen people who can from some level of nonsense become president in IW. I've heard plenty of people who've worked with the insane map as Wallace to get over 300 EVs only to be coup'd out of office in the ending because the devs presume the player must have cheated. Each ending is more absurd than the last, even going to the extreme of the first black president in 1948. It's just terrible and none of it has been thought out.</p>
    <p>I'll finish this point out by just pointing out something important: tone. Your writing should be serious, unless you're making a comedic mod. 1948IW's writing is just bad. The tone is all over the place and the scenario is trying to do about twenty things at once and thus fails at each and every one.</p>
    <p>In the RNG of Question 34 for Wallace, if you get your entire agenda passed in spite of a conservative coalition in Congress (I'm not making this up), the advisor feedback rants about John Bricker's suicide and how "Blacks are running to the streets in celebration!"</p>
    <p>Questionable language for sure, but I'm sure it's not indicative of some greater problem—</p>
    <h3>Thurmond</h3>
    <blockquote>
        "<em>To be fair Segregationists are just naturally comically evil.</em>"<br>
        "<em>Watch Uncle Ruckus from the Boondocks.</em>"<br>
        - The creator of 1948: Identity War on the post "Any tips for writing for a segregationist?"
    </blockquote>
    <p>What hasn't been said about the Thurmond side of 1948: Identity War? It is the single most controversial and polarizing thing released since 2000N, perhaps surpassing it. It's already been pointed out that Thurmond did not drop the hard R in speeches, nor was he a raving lunatic. He wasn't your racist great uncle, he was a politician. Thurmond murdering another politician, lynching MLK, I mean, it's all just completely batshit insane. Worse, it's racist. Now, I'm not calling the creators racist, but the material certainly is for the simple fact that there is no conceivable justification for the depravity of the writing. Normal people will play this and their jaw will drop in either horror or bewilderment. No matter which of these, a single phrase will often be said: "who thought this was OK to release?"</p>
    <p>But that's all been said, and I'd rather not rehash that conversation. Instead, I'd like to go into how to actually portray a segregationist. Because 1948IW certainly tries to tackle some important and complex historical themes, but unfortunately it lacks any of the maturity needed to do so effectively.</p>
    <p>To start: try to lean on the actual words of the segregationist you're portraying. Don't make them comically evil, be truthful to who they were. The fact civilized men can espouse such disgusting and evil concepts is horrifying in itself. You don't need to portray them as frothing at the mouth, that only denigrates them and makes them caricatures from whom you could not possibly learn anything.</p>
    <p>To close out this final segment, I will refer to the words of <a href="https://old.reddit.com/u/East-Rice-6234" target="_blank">u/East-Rice-6234</a> in that original post the creator of 1948IW was quoted from:</p>
    <blockquote>
        "<em>Please don't make him comically evil for the sake of displaying how evil it is. That's going to come off poorly in the writing.
        If you want to get across how bad his views were, make the writing true to him. That's all you have to do.</em>"
    </blockquote>
    <p>For my final point, I'd like to say something directly to the creators of 1948IW, but hopefully what I will say is something we can all learn from:</p>
    <h3>To the creators of 1948: Identity War,</h3>
    <p>For your next mod, I hope you will come at it with more maturity in your writing.</p>
    <p>I hope you will do actual research and try to portray history honestly in keeping with the educational core at the heart of this game.</p>
    <p>And I hope you will not rush your next mod out before it is done. Some extra minutes in the oven does wonders for any final product in any space.</p>
    <p>I meant what I said earlier in this post and I am jubilant that you've made this mod. Like I said, failing on executing a mod idea is better than not making anything at all. So I hope you will read what I've said above, and the points I've made throughout this post with openness and will be able to take from it something worthwhile, and be able to apply it to your next creation.</p>
    <p>I'm confident in you, and I'm confident it can be better.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Well, you either hated this post with all your heart and soul or agree with me. It doesn't really matter, and should you enjoy 1948IW, to each their own! If you found any enjoyment out of it, that's great, and no one can take that away from you.</p>
    <p>This is about as good a time as any to announce that this was the first installment of my new column, Writing Right! Decstar has seen fit to give me my own column on the <span class="rainbow">Devlog</span> (which is awesome!) and I hope to use this column to talk about where mods went wrong on their writing, where they went right, and how we can learn from their mistakes or triumphs. Unless Decstar doesn't like this post or hates the name, this post will be put on the log.</p>
    <p>TL;DR Identity War trash</p>
