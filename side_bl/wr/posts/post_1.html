    <p>So, 2025NL was a cool mod, but in this mod, like many other new mods coming out, I find one serious issue with the writing: in the majority of questions, the correct answer is usually the longest one. Let me show you one question from the mod as an example (from the Omtzigt side).</p>
    <figure style="overflow-x:scroll;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4TFPlfPM6o/" target="_BLANK"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qpeC8D1.png" alt="2025NL gas production question."></a></figure>
    <p>Like, you have three fairly normal answers, and then one that spans four lines and manages to hedge the whole issue in a way that would obviously be compelling to voters. And of course it's the correct answer electorally...</p>

    <p>Thank you for attending my TED Talk.</p>
    <p>This is the story throughout the mod: the longer answer is almost always the best one. But 2025NL is hardly alone in this. Plenty of other mods fall into the trap of having questions like this with one long answer, or even a slightly longer answer that covers more ground. This hampers difficulty, because it makes it much easier to sus out the correct answer if you're going in without much contextual information. And that siphons replayability.</p>
    <p>Before we can hope to address the problem, we must get at the root of it: why are the electorally correct answers often the longest? Well, to put it simply, the correct answer is often portrayed as the most complex and intuitive. As well, long answers like the example can often cover more ground and thus appear as more nuanced. Long answers can often quote another person, or an official report, thus sounding more serious and being more grounded in statistics. Meanwhile short answers are often depicted as overly simple and reductive.</p>
    <p>Two things can be true at the same time: Yes, oftentimes the correct answer should be the most constructive and complex. And yes, in reality sometimes the simplest answer is the correct one. So writers of TCT, heed my words! Mix it up a bit more! Write shorter answers! Don't throw everything you've researched about an issue into one "correct" answer!</p>
