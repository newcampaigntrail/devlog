<h2>The 11 Rules of TCT Modding</h2>
<em>7-20-2023</em>
<div id="content">
    <p>Yesterday I was perusing the infamous TCT Twitter and came upon this tweet by everyone's favorite Powellmaniac National Union Gang Member, Astrohunch; "<a href="https://twitter.com/astrohxncho/status/1680685612603674624" target="_blank">i present you all the cardinal sin of modding.</a>"  This got me thinking: What else could be considered a "cardinal sin" of modding?  Well, after consulting with several prominent modders, communing with the spirits, and journeying to the TCT Modding Center at the Smithsonian, I'm ready to present the 11 Rules of TCT Modding!  If you're breaking one of these rules, you're in trouble.  More than one, and your mod is probably really bad.  Consider this something of a companion piece for new modders to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thecampaigntrail/comments/14ri996/toms_guide_to_tct_modding_using_jets/" target="_blank">the guide</a> I published a while back.</p>

   <h3>1. You Must Research</h3>
    <p>Pretty self-explanatory, but if you want to make a mod you must do research on the subject.  And not Wikipedia; there are most likely countless free, more substantial sources for whichever topic you want to make a mod about that don't have only 80% accuracy, nor surrender the tone of a good article or book.  Wikipedia's style of writing is bland and plain, and that can seep into your writing.  I'll probably do another column in the future about why you shouldn't use Wikipedia, but consider my putting this at #1 on this list a representation of just how important research is to good modding.</p>
    <h3>2. Your Mod Must Not Be Irrevocably Broken</h3>
    <p>Again, pretty self-explanatory.  If your codes can't make it through the Loader, or breaks at any part beyond repair it is the ultimate signifier that you did not playtest your mod, or just didn't care.</p>
     <h3>2. Your Mod Must Not Be Irrevocably Broken</h3>
    <p>You should make mods about concepts you're passionate about.  Modding is a lot of work, and if you're putting that work into something you don't really care all that much it is going to show.</p>
       <h3>3. Don't Make Something You're Not Passionate About</h3>
    <p>You should make mods about concepts you're passionate about. Modding is a lot of work, and if you're putting that work into something you don't really care all that much it is going to show.</p>
     <h3>4. Handle Evil Ideologies/Persons With Maturity</h3> 
    <h3>4. Handle Evil Ideologies/Persons With Maturity</h3>
    <p>TCT is largely a historical game, which means it's going to tackle people and ideologies who we understand in the modern day as evil.  We've had mods about Nazis, Segregationists and Stalinists.  So my advice is simply to treat these topics with maturity.  Good examples of doing this successfully are 1930 Weimar and 1968 Viva Kennedy.</p>
     <h3>5. Don't Add Features Just For The Sake of Adding Features</h3>
    <p>This is more problematic than I think a lot of people realize, but essentially this rule boils down to not adding a feature to your mod outside the traditional Dan Bryan norm unless it directly aids the mod's gameplay and/or immersion.  This is probably the most forgivable sin for a modder to commit all things considered, but still something everyone should keep in mind.</p>
     <h3>6. No Text Overflow</h3>
    <p>Another rule oft-broken is not to have text overflow in answers and feedback.  Conciseness is a virtue!  Also remember, text overflow can vary between browsers so if you don't use Chrome generally best to fire it up and load your mod there just to make sure there are no problems there either (learned that lesson the hard way.)</p>
     <h3>7. No Scroll Bars In Questions And Advisor Feedback</h3>
    <p>And you should generally avoid adding scroll bars in your Code 1 too.  The scroll bars are an excuse for droning writing, and that's going to harm your mod.  Scroll bars in questions and feedback are inexcusable.</p>
     <h3>8. Think Your Lore Through</h3>
    <p>Don't just throw things out because they're cool, if you're making an intentionally realistic-seeming alt-history mod you should try to make it as plausible as possible whilst still maintaining the fun.</p>
     <h3>9. Avoid Obviously Correct Answers</h3>
    <p>Almost every mod has at least one wall of text that covers all a candidate's bases and appeals to every interest group imaginable.  A mod filled with these is a bad one.</p>
     <h3>10. Listen To Your Playtesters</h3>
    <p>This is another rule that seems simple but is too often broken by modmakers who have deluded themselves into believing their mod is perfect.  Your mod is not perfect.  Solicit playtesters and heed their advice.  You can disagree with what they're telling you but if you find yourself fighting everything they're telling you, your attitude is problematic.</p>
     <h3>11. Accept Feedback</h3>
    <p>This goes with Rule 10 to a degree, but generally don't fight with people giving you feedback.  Even if you know them to be wrong about a piece of criticism, the fact they're criticizing you at all means you could've done that thing or explained it a little better.  If you can't accept feedback you will never grow as a modder.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>I really want to go play the new Paul mod so I'm not going to spend an exorbitant amount of time here at the Conclusion, but you can also read this post on the Devblog, Writing Right.  Toodaloo!</p>
