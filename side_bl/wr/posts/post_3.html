    <p><b>Disclaimer: I'll be talking about the recent mod in which you play as Adolf Hitler ahead. See <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/thecampaigntrail/comments/13spnkv/psa_to_all_antisemites_and_neonazis/" target="_blank">this PSA</a> if you sympathize with people like him and his movement.</b></p>
    <p>Given my history with another mod that tackles offensive characters and themes that has been widely publicized on the Reddit, it may be expected that in this rendition of my column on writing in mods, Writing Rightâ„¢ I would take the side against the inclusion of the latest TCT modification, 1930 Weimar. Why? Well...</p>

    <p>But that is not the case. As it stands, I see no legitimate reason why this mod should not be included, and that this mod handles its subject matter with historical accuracy and seriousness and without needless embellishment or deliberately offensive material.</p>
    <p>Now, before I begin with this post, I must iterate this is not a commentary on the debate about whether or not it should go on the Loader specifically (there are some problems regarding German censorship laws that means if it is put on the Loader it will at most have questions censored/rewritten and at least will have a disclaimer included that the player must click through before playing). Like my last post in this column, this post is not to advance any debate but principally to help aspiring modmakers by pointing out what we can learn from the mod in question, good and/or bad.</p>
    
    <h3>A Difficult Premise</h3>
    <p>1930 Weimar is the 5th international mod, and the first to be set in Germany. Taking place during the tumult of the Weimar Republic's twilight years, the mod has the difficult job both of getting the majority-American and non-German player base invested in a mod taking place in a different nation, but also the doubly difficult task of doing so while setting that mod outside of modern memory. 1976 Italy, which I stress is one of my favorite mods, deals with these same two problems. That mod's inability to properly contextualize and educate on its setting makes the mod artificially harder than it needs to be for first-time players and gives them the consistent feeling of thinking they've chosen a reasonable-sounding answer to a simple question only to be hit with "you dope! Italian voters in 1976 love taking loans from the EEC! What were you thinking!?" and most players are left feeling frustrated rather than educated. This, in my view is why despite its overall good writing and coding 1976 Italy failed at the time to open the floodgates to new international mods and has since release been at worst forgotten among the community and at best an afterthought.</p>
    <p>1930 Weimar, on the other hand does a few things to properly contextualize the election and its setting. To start, the election year's bio provides a player with a longer-than-average explanation of politics at the time, as well as a disclaimer about the subject matter. Now, 1930 Weimar is a mod in which one plays as the Nazis, but it hardly has tunnel vision like plenty of other albeit excellent mods about third party or non-majoritarian candidates. If one were to press 'continue' and go to the party select screen, the mod gives a glimpse at what the other parties are like, and provides rounded bios to the four other major players as well as their leading candidates. This may seem like just-for-fun, but these bios gives the player some excellent basic background knowledge about the election and its central conflicts that will give him or her a fighting chance in the coming election if read carefully enough.</p>
    <p>And this emphasis on providing the player real context on what's going on is carried over into the writing of the questions, which are on the whole extensive. Plus, a good portion of the questions have two answers. Now, this may seem like a bad thing, as more choice is usually preferred to less in a game like this, but in an international scenario that takes place in 1930, this narrows the potential for error on the player's part, which is a good thing because like I said, the scenario will already be inherently difficult. Remember, for those making scenarios outside of recent American memory centered on real history, a well-written question should always provide enough context for a player to make a reasonable judgment call, but never enough to make the most reasonable answer obvious.</p>

    <h3>The End-Goal</h3>
    <p>Now, 1930 Weimar runs into another potential problem in its goal. See, the goal in the vast majority of TCT mods is to get the best electoral result, with several notable exceptions (2000N, 1844C, to an extent 1864). It's hard-coded into the brains of us TCT players to want to get the best-possible electoral result. The huge issue here is the sort of problematic example that would be set if this was the goal in a mod like 1930 Weimar. The modmaker finds a fairly clever solution to this by first making it so the Nazis cannot win the 1930 election on normal, and secondly stating outright the importance of the multiple endings to the mod. In my first playthrough, for instance, I underperformed the Nazis slightly and that prompted the eventual dissolution of the party and the taking-over by a Franco-esque dictator. Self-sabotage is also a viable way to play this mod, and even the best victory you can possibly achieve as the Nazis, the historical one that leads to the party's historical takeover ends with Hitler humiliated and dead in Berlin. And that leads me to my most important point...</p>
    
    <h3>Portraying Evil</h3>
    <p>There is no Neo-Nazi wish fulfillment in this mod. Now, in my last entry in this column, "<a href="/side_bl/wr/reader/#2" target="_blank">The Worst Mod Ever Made?</a>", I spoke at length about the problems with the mod 1948: Identity War, which achieved infamy on the Sub for its ahistoric and offensive depiction of Strom Thurmond. In that post, I didn't quite go into depth enough about what the correct method for portraying a segregationist is. Well, this mod provides a better shot at that, because unlike IW, 1930 Weimar portrays its subject matter with maturity and seriousness.</p>
    <p>To begin, let's look at two endings, the best electorally you can get on normal in both IW and 1930 Weimar:</p>
    <figure style="overflow-x:scroll;">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/I15LCzf.png" alt="1948IW Thurmond ending; it glorifies Thurmond." />

    </figure>
    <figure style="overflow-x:scroll;">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/sWLNbwC.png" alt="1930DE Hitler ending; Hitler is portrayed extremely negatively." />
        <figcaption><em>How to do something like this.</em></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Notice the difference in the two? Both are describing a sort of hate that negatively impacted the lives of millions in history. One applauds such a movement as "brilliant" and depicts its leaders coming down from Heaven like angels. Disgusting, ridiculous wish fulfillment.</p>
    <p>The other, 1930 Weimar reads like an obituary when describing the eventual victory of hate. And at the end, Hitler is roundly defeated, humiliated and described as the pitiful man he was. There is no embellishment or wish-fulfillment here, no confusion can be had by the player about the amorality of this person and this ideology.</p>
    <p>A good portrayal of historical bigotry should leave an audience going "eww." Bad portrayals of segregationists and Nazis understand this concept, but choose to emulate a cheap copy of that feeling of disgust by dramatizing the group in question and making them comically evil. This mod managed to feel really disgusting without being overdramatic. 1930 Weimar, which I would remind everyone is depicting real history, has the unfortunately all-too forgotten advantage of having done actual research on the topic and figures. It doesn't need to exaggerate the evil of men like Adolf Hitler, Josef Goebbels and Ernst Rohm, it only has to portray them truthfully. And that it does.</p>
    <p>This is the lesson we modmakers and aspiring modmakers must take from this mod. In order to successfully portray evil, we must remember these things:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Do not insert evil where evil does not exist for the sake of pointing out how evil the character you're playing is. If they're truly evil, portraying them honestly will make more of an impact.</li>
        <li>Make no allusion as to where you as a modmaker stand.</li>
        <li>Do not force players to take the most racist or offensive action in a question, always provide something of a choice.</li>
        <li>Do actual research about the motivations for evil and how it takes root.</li>
        <li>Utilize a good amount of caution to ensure the material is not needlessly offensive.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For the most part, 1930 Weimar nails these five rules, which is why it works. It specifically nails that fifth point. This mod could've been a complete disaster given the subject matter, but the modmaker comes at the topic with such care, caution and seriousness that it leaves no room for confusion about the mod's intended goal.</p>
    <p>Still, there is a great risk with a mod like this. It has opened the door to potential future mods based around the Nazis, or even Neo-Nazi groups, and it's unknown whether or not the future individuals who tackle these groups and themes will have that same caution and restraint as Augenis, this mod's creator. Here's some advice to aspiring modmakers reading this: while research is always something you should do, if you're going to feature groups like segregationists, fascists or other sorts of hateful filth, you must do your research. While it's acceptable with other mods to do minimal research, if you want to tackle these themes you have to nail it, which is why I would recommend new modmakers don't try it on their first or even second mods unless they really have a good level of education about what they're doing.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Thank you all for reading this new entry of <em>Writing Right</em> which pending <em style="color:rgb(99, 23, 23)" title="I work slowly, gimme a break!">Decstar's implementation</em> will be going on the Devblog! To those on the Subreddit not on the Discord, I would recommend also checking out <a href="/side_bl/liam/" target="_blank">Liquid Astro on Modding</a>. Liquid Astro's column is frankly much better than mine, and provides a more coding-centric look into game commentary. Until next time, folks.</p>
